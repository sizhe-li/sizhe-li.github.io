# Motivation
Conventional robots -- rigid links, discrete joints, and precise sensors -— are a historical artifact of control and planning approaches. **How can robots with diverse morphologies, mechanisms, and sensors be represented, modeled, and controlled in a general-purpose way?** Machine learning can enable imprecise, flexible, and unconventional robots to perform as effectively as traditional designs, paving the way for more affordable, adaptable, and mass-produced robots.

Achieving this vision requires new control and modeling algorithms that go beyond precise sensor feedback and idealized dynamics. Conventional methods struggle with bio-inspired and soft-rigid hybrid robots, which lack internal sensors and well-defined states. Further, standard definitions of robot actions, such as end-effector pose changes, may not capture the contact-rich and whole-body motions. Finally, general-purpose robot representation offers new perspectives on appendages and tool use, as scissors and hammers function without embedded sensors but can be considered extensions to the robot dynamics upon contacts.

These questions demand a multidisciplinary approach. Our research combines computational models (drawing chiefly on machine learning, computational perception, and physics) with unique perspetives from the design and fabrication of bio-inspired robots. Our model, Neural Jacobian Field, could inspire the development of general-purpose models of robot dynamics and the integration of vision, touch, and sound into a unified spatial representation of robotic systems.
