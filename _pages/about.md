<!-- I am a PhD student at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu/) working with [Vincent Sitzmann](https://www.vincentsitzmann.com/) and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html). My research is supported by the [MIT Presidential Fellowship](https://oge.mit.edu/fellowships/presidential-graduate-fellowship-program/).

I am interested in building models that capture the rich and *structured representation* of the physical world from *unstructured observation*. To this end, my research draws ideas from machine learning, physics, and cognitive science. The applications of my research span across robotics, computer vision, and computer graphics. 

**Prospective students & visitors**: Thank you for your interest! I encourage students from [underrepresented groups]() to reach out and will prioritize replying to these messages. For students interested in working with me, the minimum time commitment is 20 hours per week for six months. Please email me with your CV and highlight your favorite accomplishments. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
