I am a PhD student at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu/) working with [Vincent Sitzmann](https://www.vincentsitzmann.com/) and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html). Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Rochester. My research is partly supported by the [MIT Presidential Fellowship](https://oge.mit.edu/fellowships/presidential-graduate-fellowship-program/).

I am interested in building inverse models that capture the rich and *structured representation* of the physical world from *unstructured observation*. To this end, my research draws ideas from vision+graphics, robotics, and computational cognitive science.

**To master/undergraduate students**: If you would like to chat about life, career, or AI/ML research, feel free to email me. I encourage students from [underrepresented groups]() to reach out and will prioritize replying to these messages.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
