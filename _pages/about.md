I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu/), advised by [Vincent Sitzmann](https://www.vincentsitzmann.com/) and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html). My research is supported by the [MIT Presidential Fellowship](https://oge.mit.edu/fellowships/presidential-graduate-fellowship-program/). 

**Research Objectives.** I build the brains and bodies of robots. My work draws on ideas from machine learning, physics, and cognitive AI, with applications in robotics, computer vision, and computer graphics.

I study intelligent systems in a physics-inspired way, by which I don't mean injecting inductive biases, but rather building systems like a physicist seeking to understand the underlying mechanisms behind generalizations and behaviors.

**Prospective students.** Thank you for your interest! I strongly encourage students from [underrepresented groups]() to reach out. If you’re interested in working with me, please email me your CV and highlight **one of your favorite accomplishments**.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
